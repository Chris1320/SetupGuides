# Setting Up Waybar

Waybar is a status bar for Wayland compositors. We will use it to show basic information about our machine at the top of our screen. Install it and copy its configuration file to its designated location.

```bash
paru -S waybar pipewire-jack
cp -r ./dotfiles/waybar ~/.config/waybar
```
