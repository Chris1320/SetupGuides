## Description

This repository contains most of my dotfiles and notes that are used in my Arch Linux installation. You can use the [auto-install script](Contents/Automatic%20Customization.md)] to automatically install Arch Linux and the dotfiles in your system.
However, I don't guarantee that the installer covers all your needs. In such cases (or you probably do not want to start from scratch), this guide assumes that...

- You've successfully installed Arch Linux by following their
  [installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide)
  which can be found in their [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/). Otherwise, follow the [system installation guide](Contents/System%20Installation.md) before proceeding.
- You have made a [non-root user](./Contents/System%20Installation.md#add-a-non-root-user-account) in your system and is currently active.
- You are currently connected to the internet.

Some, if not all of the dotfiles, can also be used in other operating systems/distributions, but it's up to you on how you will do it since I haven't tested it on other systems yet.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> This guide is currently under active development. Documentation might be outdated because the dotfiles/scripts are updated frequently.
