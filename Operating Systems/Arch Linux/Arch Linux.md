## Description

This repository contains most of my dotfiles and notes that are used in my Arch Linux installation. You can use the [[Automatic Customization|auto-install script]] to automatically install Arch Linux and the dotfiles in your system. However, I don't guarantee that the installer covers all your needs. In such cases (or you probably do not want to start from scratch), this guide assumes that...

- You've successfully installed Arch Linux by following their [installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) which can be found in their [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/). Otherwise, follow the [[System Installation|system installation guide]] before proceeding.
- You have made a [[System Installation#Add A Non-Root User Account|non-root user]] in your system and is currently active.
- You are currently connected to the internet.

Some (if not all) of the dotfiles can also be used in other operating systems/distributions, but it's up to you on how you will do it since I haven't tested it on other systems yet.

> [!WARNING]
> 
> This guide is currently under active development. Documentation might be outdated because the dotfiles/scripts are updated frequently.
