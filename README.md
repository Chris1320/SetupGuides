# SetupGuides

This repository contains guides on how I set up software I use on my machine. Most of the guides are tested on the following operating systems:

- [Fedora Workstation 39](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/)
- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org)
- [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) ([Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/kali-linux/9PKR34TNCV07))
- [Linux Mint 21](https://linuxmint.com/)
- [Termux 0.118.0](https://termux.com/) (Android Terminal Emulator)
- [Windows 11 23H2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11)

This documentation is created using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but you should be able to read it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Chris1320/SetupGuides) too.
