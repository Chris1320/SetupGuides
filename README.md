This repository contains guides on how I set up software I use on my machines. Most of the guides are tested on the following operating systems:

- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org)
- [Fedora Workstation](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/)
- [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) ([Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/kali-linux/9PKR34TNCV07))
- [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)
- [Termux](https://termux.com/) (Android Terminal Emulator)
- [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11)

This documentation is created using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but you should be able to read it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Chris1320/SetupGuides) and [GitHub Pages](https://chris1320.github.io/SetupGuides/) too.

## Bug/Error Reporting

Only documentation errors should be reported in this repository. If you find a bug or an error in specific customization guides (e.g., a bug in one of the scripts in [Arch Linux Customization Guide](#)), please submit an issue in its dedicated repository.

## Conventional Commits

Since everything in this repository is for documentation only, I decided to use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)' types for determining changes in the guides. The `docs` type is used for updates on [SetupGuides](https://github.com/Chris1320/SetupGuides) itself.
