# Setting Up Hyprland

To start customizing Hyprland, just copy the dotfiles to `~/.config/`. Running Hyprland at this time is not yet recommended since we haven't customized the rest of the programs yet.

```bash
cp -r ./dotfiles/hypr ~/.config/hypr
```

> [!NOTE]
> 
> If you are having problems with Hyprland, see their [wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Crashes-and-Bugs/).
